This is Project: HTML/CSS for The Front End portion of Web Development 101
for The Odin Project.

The goal was to replicate the structure and appearance (only) of Google's
homepage. Responsive design and functionality were not incorporated.  

The main purpose of the exercise was to just play around with basic structure and positioning of elements. Perfection was to be avoided.
